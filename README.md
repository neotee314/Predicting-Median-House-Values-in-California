# End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Predicting Median House Values in California

## Project Overview

This repository contains my implementation of an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting median house values in Californian districts, based on various features from these districts. The project follows the structure and exercises from Chapter 2 of the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

## What I Did

- **Data Acquisition**: Fetched and loaded the housing dataset from a remote source, then explored its structure using Pandas.
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted initial data analysis to understand distributions, correlations, and missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Created histograms and other visualizations to better understand the dataset.
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and prepared the data for machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Implemented and trained machine learning models to predict median house values.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using appropriate metrics.

## About the Project

This project serves as a practical introduction to machine learning workflows, covering all steps from data collection to model evaluation. The dataset includes features like:

- Location (longitude, latitude)
- Housing median age
- Total rooms
- Total bedrooms
- Population
- Households
- Median income
- Ocean proximity

The notebook demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts and best practices using Python's popular data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb`

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model implementation
- Model evaluation techniques
- Data visualization

This project was particularly valuable for understanding the complete machine learning pipeline and how to handle real-world housing data.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements could include:

- More advanced feature engineering
- Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment of the trained model

Feel free to explore the notebook and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
