The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules.\n\nB. *Data Security*. You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.\n\nC. *External Data*. You may use data other than the Competition Data (\u201CExternal Data\u201D) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is publicly available and equally accessible to use by all participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other participants. The ability to use External Data under this Section 7.C (External Data) does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 11 (Winners Obligations). \n\n#### **8.\tSUBMISSION CODE REQUIREMENTS.**\n\nA. *Private Code Sharing*. Unless otherwise specifically permitted under the Competition Website or Competition Specific Rules above, during the Competition Period, you are not allowed to privately share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Competition Data or other source or executable code relevant to the Competition (\u201CCompetition Code\u201D). This prohibition includes sharing Competition Code between separate Teams, unless a Team merger occurs. Any such sharing of Competition Code is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification.\n\nB. *Public Code Sharing*. You are permitted to publicly share Competition Code, provided that such public sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on Kaggle.com on the discussion forum or notebooks associated specifically with the Competition for the benefit of all competitors. By so sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org][3]) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code.\n\nC. *Use of Open Source*. Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Competition Rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org][4]) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.\n\n#### **9.\tDETERMINING LEADERBOARD.** \n\nEach Submission will be scored and ranked by the evaluation metric stated on the Competition Website. During the Competition Period, the current ranking will be visible on the Competition Website\u0027s public leaderboard. The public leaderboard will be based on the public test set and the private leaderboard will be based on the private test set.\n\nIn the event of a tie, the Submission that was entered first to the Competition will be ranked higher.\n\n\nOnce a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard. If a team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. \n\n#### **10.\tDISQUALIFICATION.**\n\nCompetition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle.\n \nA disqualified participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle\u0027s sole discretion.\n \nThe competition has no specified end date, and therefore there is no final leaderboard. In the event the sponsor chooses to conclude the competition, the final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.\n\n#### **11.\tGENERAL CONDITIONS.**  \n\nAll federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations apply.   \n\n#### **12.\tPUBLICITY.**\n\nYou agree that Competition Sponsor, Kaggle and its affiliates may use your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, unless prohibited by law.\n\n#### **13.\tPRIVACY.**\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that Competition Sponsor and Kaggle may collect, store, share and otherwise use personally identifiable information provided by you during the Kaggle account registration process and the Competition, including but not limited to, name, mailing address, phone number, and email address (\u201CPersonal Information\u201D).
